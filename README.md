# NCRMPCookbook
NCRMP Cookbook template

https://kenzieknox.github.io/NCRMPCookbook/

- All links need to be kept relative for ease of transfer of site

- Site theme can be changed/overridden through **style.css**

- Pages can be added to the nav bar or nav bar dropdowns through the **_site.yml** doc

- DO NOT edit any files in the docs folder -- they will be overridden when the site is rebuilt after changes are made

- There are templates sprinkled throughout the pages to aid in keeping the organization and look of the site


WHEN MAKING SITE CHANGES:
- Make a pull request to GitHub through RStudio to make sure any changes are up to date on your machine
- Make the change in the project through RStudio
- Build the site under the "Build" tab on RStudio
- Commit the changes to GitHub (**git add -A** in the terminal is easiest, then hit commit under the Git tab on RStudio)
- Push the changes to GitHub though RStudio
